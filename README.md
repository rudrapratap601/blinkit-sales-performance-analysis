## 🔄 Project Workflow
The analysis follows a structured, industry-standard approach:

1. **Data Assessment**
   - Examined dataset structure, missing values, duplicates, and data quality issues.
   - Identified inconsistencies and columns requiring preprocessing.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values.
   - Standardized column names and data types.
   - Prepared a clean dataset for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed sales distribution and variability.
   - Studied category-wise, outlet-wise, and location-based sales patterns.
   - Explored relationships between sales and numerical attributes such as ratings, visibility, and item weight.

4. **Insight Summary**
   - Synthesized EDA findings into high-level business insights.
   - Focused on demand drivers, outlet strategy, and category performance.

5. **Business Recommendations**
   - Provided actionable recommendations related to inventory planning, outlet optimization, and regional growth strategy.
