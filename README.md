## 🎯 Project Overview  

This project is an **end-to-end Data Analytics case study** based on Blinkit sales and customer data.  
The objective is to demonstrate **real-world Data Analyst skills** by working across the full analytics pipeline — from **raw messy data** to **business-ready dashboards**.

The project is designed to closely resemble **actual internship and industry workflows**, rather than a toy or academic example.

---

## 🧠 Why Python and SQL Are Used Separately  

This project intentionally uses **two different datasets** and tools, each for a specific purpose:

### 🔹 Python (Raw / Messy Dataset)  
- Used for **data assessment, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Simulates real-world scenarios where data quality issues exist
- Best suited for understanding distributions, patterns, and anomalies

### 🔹 SQL (Clean Relational Dataset)  
- Used for **business-focused analytical queries**
- Works on structured, multi-table data (customers, orders, products, etc.)
- Best suited for joins, aggregations, CTEs, subqueries, and window functions

This separation reflects how analysts typically work with **different data layers** in real organizations.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow  

1. **Data Assessment** – Understanding structure, quality, and limitations of raw data  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, inconsistencies, and data types  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)** – Identifying trends and patterns  
4. **SQL Analysis** – Answering business questions using analytical SQL  
5. **Insight Consolidation** – Interpreting results in business terms  
6. **Dashboard Creation** – Presenting insights through Power BI  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Objective  

The Power BI dashboard is designed to:
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Highlight sales and customer behavior trends
- Support data-driven decision making
- Present insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders

---

## 🚧 Project Status  

**In Progress**  
Insights, queries, and dashboard visuals will be added and refined as analysis progresses.

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes  

- Handling messy real-world datasets  
- Performing structured exploratory analysis  
- Writing analytical SQL queries  
- Translating data into business insights  
- Building professional dashboards
